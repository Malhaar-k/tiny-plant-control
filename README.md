# Low cost plant model simulation 

Model based adaptive algorithms in control systems require an internal model to act as a reference for the controller. This project aims to make it easier to implement such control strategies.

## Future Work:
- [ ] Test how many clock cycles it requires for each step.
- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] Check if other matrix libraries reduce execution time.
